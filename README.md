My name is Armagheadon and I am a Cromulon from the Cromulon Dimension. I am here to feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms. If you do not please me, Earth shall be disqualified.

In order to please me, you will do the following:

1.  I will think of a random letter.
1.  You will try to guess the letter I am thinking of.
1.  You will type a letter with your keyboard.
    1.  If your letter matches the one I am thinking of, you will get a point in your Wins column. A new round will begin and I will think of a new letter for you to guess.
    1.  If the letter does not match the one I am thinking of, it will be recorded under "Your guesses this round."
1.  You will have 10 chances to guess the letter I am thinking of.
1.  If your 10 chances expire, a point to the Loss column will be recorded. A new round will begin and I will think of a new letter for you to guess.
